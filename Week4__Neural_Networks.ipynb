        "\n",
        "### Purpose\n",
        "This notebook serves as an introduction to working with audio data for classification problems; it is meant as a learning resource rather than a demonstration of the state-of-the-art. The techniques mentioned in this notebook apply not only to classification problems, but to regression problems and problems dealing with other types of input data as well. I focus particularly on feature engineering techniques for audio data and provide an in-depth look at the logic, concepts, and properties of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, an ancestor and the origin of deep neural networks (DNNs) today. I also provide an introduction to a few key machine learning models and the logic in choosing their hyperparameters. These objectives are framed by the task of recognizing emotion from snippets of speech audio.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "Data cleansing and feature engineering comprise the most crucial aspect of preparing machine and deep learning models alike and is often the difference between success and failure. We can drastically improve the performance of a model with proper attention paid to feature engineering. This stands for input data which is already useable for predictions; even such data can be transformed in myriad ways to improve predictive performance. For features to be useful in classification they must encompass sufficient variance between different classes. We can further improve the performance of our models by understanding the influence of and precisely tuning their hyperparameters, for which there are algorithmic aids such as Grid Search.\n",
        "\n",
        "Network architecture is a critical factor in determining the computational complexity of DNNs; often, however, simpler models with just one hidden layer perform better than more complicated models. The importance of proper model evaluation cannot be overstressed: training data should be used strictly for training a model, validation data strictly for tuning a model, and test data strictly to evaluate a model once it is tuned - a model should never be tuned to perform better on test data. To this end, K-Fold Cross Validation is a staple tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusions\n",
        "Classic machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), k Nearest Neighbours (kNN), and Random Forests have distinct advantages to deep neural networks in many tasks but do not match the performance of even the simplest deep neural network in the task of audio classification. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model is the simplest form of DNN suited to classification tasks, provides decent off-the-shelf performance, and can be precisely tuned to be accurate and relatively quick to train.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MLP provides appreciable accuracy on the RAVDESS dataset, but suffers from the relatively small number of training samples afforded by this dataset. Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are excellent DNN candidates for audio data classification: LSTM RNNs because of their excellent ability to interpret sequential data such as the audio waveform represented as a time series, and CNNs because features engineered on audio data such as spectrograms have marked resemblance to images, in which CNNs excel at recognition and discrimination between distinct patterns.\n",

        "Before training a network we must select hyperparameters, which determine the network's learning behaviour - hyperparameters determine how the network learns its weights and biases, while the network parameters determine what those weights and biases are. Each type of model (SVC, MLP, Random Forests, etc...) come with their own set of hyperparameters, and each type of optimization algorithm does as well. We may use the same optimization algorithm for two different models, but memorizing the best hyperparameters for one model won't help us with any other model and likely, not any other task even with the same model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MLP model has a number of hyperparameters significant to its learning behaviour:\n",
        "- **Alpha**: Constrains the model's weights to be within a certain bound to address overfitting; in range [0,1], parameterizes l2 penalty which defines how steeply the cost function modifies weights in proportion to their magnitude, i.e. **regularizes** the cost function and so is also called the regularization term. In practice, **higher alpha more steeply penalizes large weights.**\n",
        "- **Activation function:** Determines the output of a neuron by the transformation applied to the set of inputs to that neuron\n",
        "- **Solver:** Algorithm(s) used for optimization of our weights (with backpropogation This **gradient descent** in the case of the MLP classifier)\n",
        "- **Learning rate:** How large of a change the optimization algorithm makes to the model's weights at each training iteration, in\n",

Since we are performing multiclass classification, our MLP network has one neuron in its output layer for each class label. In our case 8 output neurons, one per emotion.\n",

There are many opinions on the matter, but there is relative consensus in that **many tasks rarely benefit from more than one hidden layer**, i.e. one hidden layer is sufficient in most cases. The number of neurons in that hidden layer is a less obvious choice, but it seems from literature that a number between the input layer and output layer size is a good starting point. At any rate, the time complexity of training our model scales exponentially with the number of hidden layers, so let's keep that number at the minimum, and likely optimum of 1.\n",

        "Grid search is relatively simple to understand - we specify a set of candidate values for each hyperparameter, and grid search tries all combinations of those hyperparameter values to build and score potential models against our training and validation data. Grid search scores sets of hyperparameters by building a validation set from the training set we give it.\n",

We shouldn't use grid search to look for hyperparameters we can easily tune later, such as the number of training iterations (# of forward+backward passes through the network for each _batch_ of training samples); if we do so, we significantly inflate the computational cost with little return. For these hyperparameters we should choose values which are usually reasonable from a literature search (...from stackexchange).\n",

A batch size in range [1, #samples] is common - in our case, [1,1440\\*0.8]. [**Mini-batches**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-mini-batch-gradient-descent-configure-batch-size/) in the set [32, 64, 128, 256] are usually encouraged, especially on smaller datasets. **Smaller batches** cause more frequent weight updates and faster convergence - faster learning - though each update is less accurate compared to a larger batch. **Larger batches** train on a larger set of inputs simultaneously, and so may optimize loss better at each iteration due to a more accurate gradient computation - however, large batches may encourage overfitting and worsen generalization error."

So it can be written as  f(x)=max(0,x). While our **hidden layer use the relu function** for its activation on each neuron, our **output layer will necessarily use the softmax function** - an exponential normalization function - in order to scale output neuron values to a probability between \\[0,1\\] for each class (emotion). Softmax does this normalization by taking the exponent of the value of each output neuron and dividing that by sum of the exponentiated output values, producing _n_ probabilities for _n_ classes. We then choose the highest probability as the predicted class for a set of input features.

        "Finally, to highlight the importance of proper model validation and get a better idea of our model's performance,\n",
        "we're going to use K-Fold Cross-Validation (K-Fold CV). We split our training dataset into _K_ unique validation sets (_K_ sets/folds) - the train/validation split being determined by _K_ where each _validation set = (100/K)%_ of the entire dataset, the training set being composed of the remaining _K-1_ validation sets. The term cross-validation refers to validating the model on multiple validation sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "The terminology here may be somewhat confusing, because we usually **split our 80% _training_ set into a _training_ and _validation_ set at each iteration of K-Fold CV.** We reserve the actual _test_ set - the one we made originally with an 80/20 split of the entire dataset - for checking our model's performance _after_ we have tuned its hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this way, K-Fold CV will train and score _K_ different versions of our classifier.\n",
        "Note that while training sets overlap (unless otherwise defined, e.g. sklearn's GroupKFold), validation sets never overlap.\n",
        "We'll use 10-fold CV, with _K=10_ being a choice giving average scores of models with fairly low bias and moderate variance due in part to the resulting 90/10 train/validation ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "**K-Fold CV trains our model on _K=10_ different, overlapping training folds and check its performance against _K=10_ validation folds.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Smaller datasets would theoretically be better scored with **higher _K_,** meaning we will have a larger portion of our dataset in training sets and a greater overlap of training samples between folds - this way we better represent a small dataset, have more training data, and hopefully provide a **better estimate of the model's true generalization error**, though at the cost of **higher variance because the _K_ estimates of our model's performance are correlated** (though there are exceptions). In the extreme case, and for computationally inexpensive models, **leave-one-out K-Fold CV (LOOCV)** can be used to construct training folds consisting of all samples-1, and 1 sample with in the validation fold; _each training fold differs by just 1 sample_ and this method provides adequate training data for each model validation on smaller training datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sine we're training a classifier, we use **StratifiedKFold which preserves the percentage of samples in each class** (emotion) for each fold. Although we have a balanced dataset, Stratified K-Fold CV is especially important when classifying an imbalanced dataset. We also set shuffle=True to shuffle the order of sample classes in each fold to match the default behaviour of sklearn's train_test_split so we can accurately compare that to the K-Fold CV score.\n",

Again, the gap between the training score curve and cross-validation score curve shows us that the model has an extremely high variance and - it scores perfectly on training data but poorly in cross-validation because it is seriously overfit - the model does not generalize well at all on test data.\n",

        "The MLPClassifier is powerful in that it achieves appreciable performance with relatively little effort invested in exploratory analysis, hyperparameter optimization, and model architechture; especially taking advantage of grid search, and much more so when we know how to tune each hyperparameter individually.\n",

        "We're going to have to explore more complicated deep learning methods to get real performance on this dataset. **Long-Short-Term-Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are excellent DNN candidates for audio data classification: LSTM RNNs because of their excellent ability to interpret sequential data such as the audio waveform represented as a time series; CNNs because features engineered on audio data such as spectrograms have marked resemblance to images, in which CNNs excel at recognizing and discriminating between distinct patterns.**\n"
